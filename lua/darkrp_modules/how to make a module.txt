DarkRP modules are a nice and easy way to modify DarkRP. However, they do require some knowledge about Lua.

How to make a DarkRP module
---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
1. Make a folder in here. Don't give it a crazy name. Make it lowercase, no weird characters and no spaces
2. Make Lua files in it.
	Files that start with sv_ are automatically run by the server
	Files that start with cl_ are automatically run by the client. You don't have to worry about AddCSLuaFile
	Files that start with sh_ are automatically run by the server and the client. You don't have to worry about AddCSLuaFile


Have an example of what a module would look like (from the root of this addon)

lua/
	darkrp_modules/
		better_hud/
			sv_sendtexturefiles.lua
			cl_coolhud.lua
			cl_elements.lua
			cl_doorview.lua
